# EE364B Project: Real Time Control of Non-Convex and Stochastic Energy Resources

Thomas Navidi, Xiao Chen, and Bennet Meyers

Make Anaconda environment for the project:

conda create --name myenv --file spec-file.txt

`convexcontrol.main` contains the master controller algorithm for the R1 and R2 cases.

`convexcontrol.resources` contains the energy resource model classes.

All plots for the final report were generated in Jupyter Notebooks, organized in the `notebooks` directory.
